What was the most challenging part of translating from Python concepts to Java syntax?

The main problem I had with translating my Python concepts to Java syntax was the syntax itself. I struggled a little bit with variables declaration at first and even some with semi-colons, but after 
a few minutes I figured everything out.

When did you use AI assistance and what did it help you with?

I used AI assistance mainly for syntax and one bug fix for the quiz challenege. It helped me for those problems but I didn't use it for anything else like code writing.

Was there anything in Java that you liked better than in Python?

Not really. I didn't enjoy Java as much but maybe in the future as I continue to use Java will I see the differeneces and have more of a preference.
